1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

When the number of hidden units increases, the model’s capacity to learn complex patterns improves, leading to higher accuracy up to a certain point. 

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

For very few hidden nodes (1–2), the model under-fits and accuracy is low.
As hidden nodes increase (3–20), accuracy improves significantly.
With very high hidden nodes (50), accuracy might plateau or slightly drop due to overfitting, as the model memoizes the training data instead of generalising well.
